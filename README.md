a set of python files to assist in managing grade information for import/export from/to a Scholar ecosystem

## The Problem
The Scholar course-management system has its own special way of managing assignment feedback and grades.  
One of the more useful features is that it provides the ability to import/export a `zip` archive of an assignment providing a file structure containing 
all relevant information.
Because it is often much more convenient to enter comments and grades in a text file locally, I created several scripts that assist 
in the conversian between individual comment files and the Scholar directory format.

still a work in progress :-)
